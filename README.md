# hello-world
This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow.

Hello, I am Patrick Nguyen, and I am studying at the University of Louisville. Currently, I am studying Computer Information Systems with a track in Cybersecurity. Additionally, I am getting a degree in Music too. It's an odd combo, but I feel passionate about both subjects. Cybersecurity is my main focus though.
